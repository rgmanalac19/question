    </h2>
    <p>I know this is not your typical love letter, but I hope you'd still like it. I just want to convey my feelings for you in the way that I am good at.</p>
    <p>We've been together for almost two years now, and I am still in love with youâ€”it's getting deeper and deeper every single second. My love for you is immeasurable and infinite. I always pray to the Lord that you'll be mine until death do us part, and even after death, I'd choose to be with you.</p>
    <p>Thank you for helping me improve my life, giving me a clear picture of what I want to do, and making my life happy. I cannot stress enough how much I miss you every day. It makes me sad when I have to leave for work with you lying in my arms. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I love you for that. I will never leave you no matter what happens, and we will go through thick and thin together. I promise to be the best man in your life until the end of time.</p>
